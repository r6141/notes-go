## Introduction to Wave Optics

Wave optics is a Branch of optics that describes the behavior of light in terms of waves. In this approach, light is considered as an electromagnetic wave that propagates through space and undergoes interference, diffraction, and polarization. The properties of the waves can be described using the equations of wave motion, which are derived from Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism.

The basic concepts of wave optics can be summarized using the following equations:

* Wave equation: $\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2} - \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial t^2} = 0$
* Huygens' principle: $E(r, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\frac{E(r', t - \frac{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}'|}{c})}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}'|}dV'$
* Interference: $I(x) = I_1(x) + I_2(x) + 2\sqrt{I_1(x)I_2(x)}\cos\delta$
* Diffraction: $\frac{\sin\theta}{\lambda} = \frac{a}{D}$
* Polarization: $E = E_0\sin(\omega t - kx)\hat{i} + E_0\sin(\omega t - kx + \phi)\hat{j}$
