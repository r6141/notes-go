## Introduction to Ray Optics

Ray optics, also known as geometric optics, is a branch of optics that describes the behavior of light in terms of rays. In this approach, light is considered as a collection of rays that travel in straight lines and undergo reflection, refraction, and diffraction. The path of the rays can be traced using the laws of reflection and refraction, which are derived from the principles of Snell's law and Fermat's principle of least time.

The basic concepts of ray optics can be summarizzed using the following equations:

* Snell's law: $n_1\sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2$
* Fermat's principle of least time: $\delta t = \frac{\delta l}{c}$
* Law of reflection: $\theta_i = \theta_r$
* Law of refraction: $\frac{\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$
