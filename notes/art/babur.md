# Electrostatics Equations

## Coulomb's Law
The force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's Law:

$$F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$

where:
- $F$ is the force between the charges,
- $k$ is Coulomb's constant,
- $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of the charges, and
- $r$ is the distance between the charges.

## Electric Field
The electric field at a point due to a point charge is given by:

$$E = \frac{kq}{r^2}$$

where:
- $E$ is the electric field at the point,
- $k$ is Coulomb's constant,
- $q$ is the magnitude of the charge, and
- $r$ is the distance between the point charge and the point of interest.

## Electric Potential
The electric potential at a point due to a point charge is given by:

$$V = k\frac{q}{r}$$

where:
- $V$ is the electric potential at the point,
- $k$ is Coulomb's constant,
- $q$ is the magnitude of the charge, and
- $r$ is the distance between the point charge and the point of interest. 

$$\boxed{V=\int_{\infty}^{r} E \cdot dr}$$

where:
- $E$ is the electric field at the point, and
- $r$ is the distance between the point charge and the point of interest.
